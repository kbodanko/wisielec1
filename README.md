**The heart of the project:**
Practising work with arrays

**Project describe:** My first own game, maked for my nephews, who love Gumball and were my first testers <3 This is the hangman with words to guess from a Gumball cartoon. The lists of used words: Gumball, Darwin, Anais, Penny, Tobias, Bobert, Jajogłowi, Rocky, Nicole, Richard, Watterson, Larry. The game uses the https://sweetalert.js.org/ library for nice modals with alerts. Times when I had a very basic level of CSS, but the game made my nephews fun.
